# Kilo Editor C++ port

A C++ port of snaptoken's "build from scratch" booklet for a basic text editor in about 1000 lines of C (the kilo editor, written by Antirez).
snaptoken's guide walks you through building the editor in various well explained steps. The text editor is antirezâ€™s kilo, with some changes and
written C++ in a single file with no dependencies, and it implements all the basic features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.
