A C++ port of snaptoken's "build from scratch" guide for basic text editor in about 1000 lines of C (the kilo editor, written by Antirez).

Originally in about 1000 lines of C in a single file with no dependencies, and it implements all the basic features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.
